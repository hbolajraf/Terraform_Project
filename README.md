## Description
This project is related to a post that I share within my website : https://hbolajraf.net/
It describe how to create Azure ressources using terraform.
This Terraform script automates the provisioning of Azure resources required for implementing a real-time financial transaction monitoring system using Azure Event Hub. The script will create the following resources:
- Azure Event Hub Namespace
- Azure Event Hub
- Azure Event Hub shared access policy
- Azure Blob Storage Account (for checkpoints)
- Azure Storage Container (within the Blob Storage account)

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your machine
- Azure CLI installed and authenticated

## The terraform folder project wil have the following structure  :

```bash
Terraform_Project
│   .terraform.lock.hcl        # Lock file generated by Terraform to track provider dependencies
│   main.tf                    # Main Terraform configuration file that contains the Azure resources to be created
│   outputs.tf                 # Output definitions for Terraform
│   provider.tf                # Provider configuration for Terraform
│   terraform.tfstate          # State file to track the resources managed by Terraform
│   terraform.tfstate.backup   # Backup of the Terraform state file
│   variables.tf               # Variable definitions for Terraform
│
└── .terraform                 # Directory containing Terraform's internal files
```
